# Event Sourced Forms

The reason for this project is to build an easy to use and easy to expand form building solution to offer to my non-profit clients. From what I could find on the internet already, the products that already do similar either force vender lockin at a level that I don't want (Google Forms) or cost money. Being that I'm mostly writing this for organizations that don't have much cashflow, free is important. 

The second reason is to play around with event sourcing. After watching a few talks on the architecture, it's very close to how I internalize system architecture naturally (hence my tendency towards writing in a FP nature and learning Clojure). I was tempted to write this in CLJS but didn't since I felt that I could give a better product in less time using ES6/React


### Goals

 - Simple (aesthetically and architecturally)
 - Minimize one way doors without losing simplicity
 - Expandable
